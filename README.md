# BMI-Calculator
This is a Simple project based on body mass index calculator. 
Here's a dynamic Body Mass Index (BMI) calculator in Python that: 
Asks for user input for weight (in kg) and height (in meters),
Validates the input (ensures numbers are positive),
Calculates the BMI,  
Categorizes the result (e.g., underweight, normal, overweight, etc.), 
Loops to allow multiple calculations if the user wishes.
